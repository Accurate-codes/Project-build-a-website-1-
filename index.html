                <h1>Welcome speech</h1> 
                <p class="welcome">Dear Parents & Guardians,

                    A very warm and happy welcome to the Abuja Preparatory School learning community. We look forward to sharing an exceptional academic relationship with you, one that will be supportive and successful.
                    
                    It is my aim to develop and maintain a happy and vibrant school in which everyone is safe, treated with respect and encouraged to learn. This is made possible by the dynamic young and energetic staff who between them bring a wealth of experiences and are united in their intention of improving children’s learning.
                    
                    As a Head Teacher I am committed to developing children as a whole; providing an exciting and challenging environment where all children can achieve their potential. At Abuja Preparatory School we make learning irresistible enabling children of all abilities to fly. Our children feel safe to develop as independent learners, developing creatively and academically. Above all I want children in my school to be happy, developing skills to become caring, responsible members of society, have a love of learning and lively enquiring minds.
                    
                    Abuja Prep is a Cambridge International School – this means it is an approved Curricular and Assessment Centre for Cambridge International Examinations (CIE), the region’s largest and best known global curricular body. CIE is part of the UK’s University of Cambridge, which has been a pillar of educational excellence for over 800 years. The school has had to meet the high standards insisted on by CIE to be awarded this status. Our pupils get high scores in their end of year assessments.
                    
                    We are affiliated with: National Day Nurseries Association; UK Swim England Association: French Institute; The British Council and the Society for Education and Training UK. We off the STEAM programme (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Maths) as part of our curriculum as well as our after school programme. We have a Football squad called Super Prep. We offer an extensive range of after school clubs (Please note that currently our After School Programme is not running due to COVID restrictions).
                    
                    At Abuja Prep, the ‘children come first’. Bringing out the best in each child is our constant aim. We believe that children should receive a broad, balanced and child-centred education. This will develop an effective combination of creativity, confidence and courtesy, which will equip our young as global citizens to cope with the demands of life in the 21st century, wherever they may live in the world.
                    
                    In today’s rapidly changing and challenging world we believe it to be the school’s primary task to foster, in its community, a life- long love of learning and a sense of responsible citizenship. Our educational programmes are designed to develop the understanding, skills and attitudes that support this. We believe that as we move through the processes of inquiry, discussion, decision making and reflection, we develop an understanding of ourselves, of other people and of our world.
                    
                    Abuja Preparatory School provides a very special learning environment that develops outstanding, global citizens who are moral, respectful, and have a strong sense of identity. The future will rely on technology, especially in AI (Artificial Intelligence) and renewable energy. Our children are prepared for the challenges of the future. As such, they must be equipped with a strong foundation in the basics (Reading, Writing and Arithmetic) as well as the technical skills to compete in the 21st century. We have high expectations of our pupils and respect their social, cultural, linguistic, religious and ethnic backgrounds.
                    
                    We are very proud of the achievements of our past and present pupils. Abuja Preparatory School is unique – it offers not only an impressive academic programme, but a fascinating curriculum both in and beyond the classroom. We constantly monitor and update with the latest trends and innovations in education in the UK and elsewhere to bring the best practice for our children in accordance with the highest international standards. Being part of the Cambridge and Abuja Prep family is the best investment you will ever make in your child’s future.
                    
                    Kind regards,
                    
                    Emmanuel.
                    Head of School.
